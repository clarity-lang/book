# Clarity Book

_Clarity of Mind_ is both an introductory as well as a reference book for the
Clarity smart contract language. Clarity is developed as a joint effort of
[Hiro PBC](https://hiro.so), [Algorand](http://algorand.com), and various other
stakeholders, that originally targets the Stacks blockchain. A significant
innovation in the field of smart contract development, Clarity allows you to
write more safe and secure smart contracts. The language optimises for
readability and predictability and is purpose-built for developers working
applications with high-stakes transactions.

The book is free and open source, written in Markdown files. You can clone this
repository and build a HTML version of the book. Different build scripts are
expected to be added in the future. (PDF, ePub, and so on.)

The book can be accessed online here: http://book.clarity-lang.org.
